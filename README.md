### Build
For windows, you can use cmake to generate a vs solution first(Visual Studio 2017 is suggested, which have test passed).

Note you have to assign your boost path.

Or if you have a codeblock on your device, you can use build/renderer-dev.workspace directly.

For linux: 

```
cd build
cmake .
make
```
